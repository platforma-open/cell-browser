# Overview

Provides interactive visualization tools for exploring single-cell RNA sequencing data. The block automatically discovers and integrates associated data from upstream analysis blocks, including UMAP or t-SNE embeddings, cell type annotations, cluster assignments, and gene expression values.

The block offers two complementary visualization types: UMAP scatter plots for visualizing cell embeddings colored by annotations or metadata and violin plots for comparing gene expression distributions across groups or clusters. These visualizations enable researchers to explore cell populations, validate clustering results, examine marker gene expression patterns, and assess data quality across experimental conditions.

The block integrates seamlessly with upstream single-cell analysis blocks, automatically linking count matrices with their associated dimensionality reduction embeddings, cluster annotations, and metadata for comprehensive data exploration and publication-ready visualizations.
